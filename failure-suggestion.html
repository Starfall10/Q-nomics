            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>As the UK faces a cost-of-living crisis, despite forecasts of a decreasing inflation rate, the economic data released in the previous weeks reveals that the YoY inflation rate remains at 6.7%. Moreover, the soaring high interest rates benchmarked by the Bank of England are maintained at a 15-year high of 5.25%. This current economic situation has presented numerous challenges for start-ups and small businesses within the UK making it more difficult for them to access funding and deal with business expenses.</p>
