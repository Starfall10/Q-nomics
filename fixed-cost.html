            <h2>Fixed-Costs</h2>
            <p>Small businesses in London find it hard to deal with fixed costs. Firstly, the rent for places to run the business is very high in the city, which makes it difficult for small businesses with limited budgets. Also, because living costs are high, employees may ask for higher wages, adding to the business's expenses. On top of that, there are other costs and regulations that businesses have to deal with. The tough competition in London's market also makes it hard for small businesses to make a steady income, making it a challenge to cover their fixed costs. All these factors make it a struggle for small businesses to manage their expenses in London.</p>
            <p>In response to these challenges, our team acknowledges the difficulties faced by small businesses in London with fixed costs. Our plan involves thorough research, directly talking to local customers and studying competitors. By understanding customer preferences and learning from successful competitors, we aim to find ways to manage costs effectively and stand out in the market.</p>
